## Projects

### Brain Tumor Detection using Deep Learning 
#### End-to-end deep learning, flask

- Imported MRI images of brain dataset from kaggle and performed data visualization, data augmentation and preprocessing
- Used various deep learning architectures such as CNN, MobileNet-v2 and VGG-16 on preprocessed dataset
- Compared these architectures to find out which algorithm can efficiently and accurately predict brain tumour and deployed project using flask

### Food demand forecasting using machine learning

- Performed data Preprocessing on train and test data
- Used XGBoost and LightGBM algorithms to predict the number of orders for each city and each recipe
- Compared these two algorithm results with the real values to find out which algorithm can efficiently and accurately forecast the number of orders

### Gesture controlled vehicle using openCV 
#### openCV, Mediapipe

- Used openCV library to detect both hand and head gestures via webcam
- Used pre-trained models in Mediapipe framework for performing hand and face gesture tracking
- When system’s camera detects gesture, it’ll process the image and verifies with predetermined positions for left, right, back and acceleration. Accordingly the system will display the output
