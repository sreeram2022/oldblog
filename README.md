# My website ([https://ericmurphy.xyz](https://ericmurphy.xyz))

My personal website for writing various thoughts and other nonsense.

## Curious how this site is made?

It's made with the static site generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). If you'd like to learn more, I've made [a few video tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwkjqMs7ZYI&list=PLnur5_dvCveF8HvYJAjdKLLm1De1Js_Nr&index=2) about it in the past. I've also made a [starter theme](https://github.com/ericmurphyxyz/hugo-starter-theme) you can use to get started.
